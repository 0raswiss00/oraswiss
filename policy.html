<main>

    <h2>General Return Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        We want you to be satisfied with your purchase from Ora Swiss.
        If you are not happy with your item, you may be eligible to return it
        under the conditions described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Return Period</h2>
    <p>
        You may request a return within <strong>30 days</strong> from the date
        you receive your package, as confirmed by the carrier’s delivery
        information.
    </p>

    <h2>Eligibility for Returns</h2>
    <p>To be eligible for a return, the item must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be in its original, unused condition</li>
        <li>Include all original packaging, tags, and accessories</li>
        <li>Include any certificates or documents provided with the watch
            (for example from The Watch Register or Enquirus, where applicable)</li>
        <li>Not be damaged due to misuse, impact, or unauthorized repairs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Returns for Watches Above 1,500 €</h2>
    <p>
        For watches with a value above <strong>1,500 €</strong>, any certificate
        from <strong>The Watch Register</strong> and any ownership transfer
        documentation from <strong>Enquirus</strong> must be returned together
        with the watch. Failure to return such documentation may affect your
        eligibility for a full refund.
    </p>

        on how and where to send your package. Returns sent without prior
        authorization may not be accepted.
    </p>

    <h2>Return Shipping Costs</h2>
    <p>
        Unless the return is due to our error (wrong item, defective item),
        the customer is generally responsible for the cost of return shipping.
    </p>

    <h2>Inspection of Returned Items</h2>
    <p>
        Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it to ensure it meets
        our return conditions. If approved, the refund or exchange will be
